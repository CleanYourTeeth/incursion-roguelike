0.6.9Y3: ADD DATE
- https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/32/oil-of-transformation-multiplies-stackable: Fix bug where when items change their type, perhaps from a rod to a staff, they get multiplied in quantity.
- https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/35/skill-typos: Spelling fixes in skill descriptions.

0.6.9Y2: 2014-03-28
- Fix bug where saved games were not found, as the old Allegro pattern with two asterisks failed because libtcod file name matching only handles one asterisk.

0.6.9Y1: 2014-03-25
- First release of the updated open source code.
- Replaced the dated Allegro 2.x as the base framework, with libtcod and it's underlying SDL2.
