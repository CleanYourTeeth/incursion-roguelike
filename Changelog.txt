- https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/35/skill-typos: Spelling fixes in skill descriptions.
- https://bitbucket.org/rmtew/incursion-roguelike/issue/34/capital-letters-not-working-shift-letter: Fix shifted keys and various other keys not working.  Not guaranteed to be correct, but is better than before.

0.6.9Y2: 2014-03-28
- Fix bug where saved games were not found, as the old Allegro pattern with two asterisks failed because libtcod file name matching only handles one asterisk.

- First release of the updated open source code.
- Replaced the dated Allegro 2.x as the base framework, with libtcod and it's underlying SDL2.
